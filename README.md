This repository will store some of the basic data and posteriors for the young planetary system HD63433bc, for the paper "TESS Hunt for Young and Maturing Exoplanets (THYME) III: a two-planet system in the 400 Myr Ursa Major Group" (Mann et al. 2020). 

The posteriors are heavily trimmed to fit within space constraints. If the full posteriors are required, please contact me. Note that within the posteriors, gpparlogq1 corresponds to ln(deltaQ) and gpparlogq2 corresponds to ln(Q0) in the paper text. 

If you use any of this material, please cite Mann et al. (2020). Note that this implementation of [MISTTBORN](https://github.com/captain-exoplanet/misttborn) is specific to this system, and will not run on others without adjustments to the code.
